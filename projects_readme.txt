    - Working with Google Fonts
    - Small Icons: (Better than using images for icons because they can be customised)

    - Container margin(external to Container) and padding(internal to Container), EdgeInsets
    - How Containers and rows can be replaced by Card and ListTiles to achieve better look
    - Padding can be added as parent class for widgets that doesn't have padding property
    - Divider class used inside SizedBox for adding horizontal line

    - How to prevent large images from overfitting the screen using expanded Widget i.e expanded widget for flexible layouts
    - flex property of expanded widget for adjusting how much to expand across the main axis
    - How to wrap a widget with a center,row,column widget using flutter inspector and delete parent widget without deleting
        the child widget using the yellow light bulb.
    - Working with flat button which already has a padding for its child widget so if its child was already padded then remove 
        the pading for it
    - Flat Button has on pressed property which is defined by a void callback fucntion which has a syntax (){//your code}
        i.e. it is an anonymous function, function without name
    - Print message in the run window using print();
    - Hot reload accomodate the changes only under the build() function and not outside it
    - Dart data types
        String, int, double and bool
        Dart variables are dynamic (like python and js) when not initialized but static when initialized(like java and cpp)
                eg. var a; //any data type value can be assigned to a
                    var a = 2 //only int values can be assigned to a;
        Data types of dart varibales also can be explicitly declared : 
            String s;
            int a;
            dynamic b; //any data type value can be assigned to b
    - avoid var and dynamic datatypes to prevent code error
    - the body of a Scaffold widget can be a user defined stateless widget class
    - stateful class requires the changing variable value which change the state of the app to be declared under a separate 
        function called setState(){//your code}

    - sounds, texts etc are added the same way images are added i.e creating a folder and then updating the assets section
        in the .yaml file
    - how to use already developed flutter packages to reduce work and save development time
    - if floder name is assets then to need to mention folder name while using the images, audio etc. in the assets folder
    - Flutter function : for using kwargs equivalent named arguments, we must enclosed the keywords inside {} .Eg
            print(add(n1:1, n2:11));

            int  add( {int n2,int n1} ){
                return n1+n2;
            }

    - working with List<widgets> or List<Icon>
    - to mark that a typo is not wrong word but a unique word for you, right click the word and on spelling
        set it accordingly
    - dart classes and objects, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
    - abstraction : dividing a huge class into smaller and simpler classes for easy use and scalability
    - encapsulation : making class properties(variable, list etc) private by just starting the name by an underscore "_"
    - inheritance : class a inherits class b by typing, class a extends b
    - polymorphism : child class a of parent class b overrides a method by typing @overrride above it.
            eg. class Parent{
                void printAge(){
                    print('I am 55');
                }
            }
                
                class Child extends Parent{
                    @override
                    void printAge(
                        print('I am 20');
                    )
                }
            a child class can also carry on the method of parent and also add some new things to it by :
                classes SecondChild extends Parent{
                    @overrride
                    void printAge(){
                        super.printAge();
                        print('Tommorow is my birthday');  
                    }
                }
                on calling it, the console will print :
                I am 55
                Tommorow is my birthday
